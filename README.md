# What Is In Your Starbucks Order? ☕️


## Overview

Coming from India, I've never seen so many people enthusiastic about Starbucks. However, in San Francisco and the United States in general, Starbucks is the majority of the population's survival kit. We all consume food and beverages, but relatively few of us are aware of what we are eating or drinking. I'll be undertaking a nutritional analysis of the food and drinks available at Starbucks as part of the project.
